project creating a multiplayer word game (similar to Boggle) where people on the internet raced against\r\n          each other to get the highest score within the time limit. Letters were arranged in a hexagonal shape,\r\n          so each was connected to 4-6 other letters (depending on if it was an edge/corner).\r\n          Players would click/draw a string of connected letters to spell out a word. Points are awarded for length,\r\n          with bonus points for difficult letters.<br />\r\n          Since it’s multiplayer, the game is generated on a Java server.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The rules for generating the grid were that it could be of 3 different sizes, must contain a minimum\r\n          number of words, and had a blacklist of words that must never appear (since it’s aimed at children).\r\n          This meant that the words on the grid had to be known at the time of creation. A brute-force approach\r\n          going through the millions of paths through the grid took several seconds after the time is exacerbated\r\n          by applying the rules. A competitor was found with a similar game and their game took a while to start,\r\n          so it appears they were doing the brute force approach.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The application was optimised by combining a pathfinding algorithm with the Trie data structure to\r\n          quickly generate a random grid while also knowing the consequence of each letter being placed by the algorithm,<br />\r\n          such as whether it would create an undesired word or break one of the rules regarding how the grid should look.<br />\r\n          This took the processing time down to ~2-10ms.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <div className={styles.images}>\r\n\r\n          <StaticImage\r\n            src=\"../images/projects/PlayLive_Leaderboard.webp\"\r\n            quality={95}\r\n            alt=\"PlayLive Leaderboard\"\r\n            width={totalWidth/2}\r\n          />\r\n          <StaticImage\r\n            src=\"../images/projects/PlayLive_AvatarSelect.webp\"\r\n            quality={95}\r\n            alt=\"PlayLive Avatar Select\"\r\n            width={totalWidth/2}\r\n          />\r\n\r\n          <StaticImage\r\n            src=\"../images/projects/PlayLive_Game.webp\"\r\n            quality={95}\r\n            alt=\"PlayLive Gameplay\"\r\n            width={totalWidth/2}\r\n          />\r\n          <StaticImage\r\n            src=\"../images/projects/PlayLive_EndScreen.webp\"\r\n            quality={95}\r\n            alt=\"PlayLive End Screen\"\r\n            width={totalWidth/2}\r\n          />\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n      </Project>\r\n      <Project title=\"Multi-year Greenfield Hybrid Angular App\">\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          Small team creating a major new SaaS product for the company, branching from the school market to parents & children.\r\n          This was a new platform to host pre-existing activities in a new, gamified, context outside the classroom.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Working closely with the art team, this was incredibly rich and animated, to give a game-like experience.\r\n          Children could progress through to harder content and earn &quot;gems&quot; for their avatar.\r\n          It has a <a href=\"https://lumen.laravel.com/\">Laravel Lumen</a> back-end and an <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\">AngularJS</a> front-end.\r\n          Since I was aware <a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular 2</a> (now just &quot;Angular&quot;) was being created, I set up the groundwork for the app to use\r\n          Component Based Development, reflecting the patterns Angular 2 was using.<br />\r\n          I also did this because I believed it was a cleaner approach than our existing codebase at the time,\r\n          and being on the ground-floor of this product, I had a chance to change that.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          My position within this team is probably what got me promoted to Senior Programmer.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <div className={styles.images}>\r\n\r\n          <StaticImage\r\n            src=\"../images/projects/Novabods_Rover.webp\"\r\n            quality={95}\r\n            alt=\"Novabods Subject Select\"\r\n            width={totalWidth/2}\r\n          />\r\n          <StaticImage\r\n            src=\"../images/projects/Novabods_Level.webp\"\r\n            quality={95}\r\n            alt=\"Novabods Content Select\"\r\n            width={totalWidth/2}\r\n          />\r\n\r\n          <StaticImage\r\n            src=\"../images/projects/Novabods_Content.png\"\r\n            quality={95}\r\n            alt=\"Novabods Content Gameplay\"\r\n            width={totalWidth/2}\r\n            objectFit=\"contain\"\r\n          />\r\n          <StaticImage\r\n            src=\"../images/projects/Novabods_AvatarSelect.png\"\r\n            quality={95}\r\n            alt=\"Novabods Avatar Select\"\r\n            width={totalWidth/2}\r\n          />\r\n\r\n          <StaticImage\r\n            src=\"../images/projects/Novabods_Dashboard.png\"\r\n            quality={95}\r\n            alt=\"Novabods Dashboard\"\r\n            width={totalWidth/2}\r\n          />\r\n          <StaticImage\r\n            src=\"../images/projects/Novabods_ManageAccount.png\"\r\n            placeholder=\"none\"\r\n            quality={95}\r\n            alt=\"Novabods Account Management\"\r\n            width={totalWidth/2}\r\n          />\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n      </Project>\r\n      <Project title=\"Student Assessment Report\">\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          A large data-visualisation project involving the whole department to improve how we present student progress\r\n          to teachers.
